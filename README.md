# WolfHedron-CRT-Mega-Bezel-Shader-Preset

## IMPORTANT INFO BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD!

### 1 - THIS SHADER PRESET MAY NOT RUN WELL ON WEAKER OR OLDER HARDWARE, I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY TESTED. SO JUST A WARNING.

### 2 - THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY PRESET MADE FOR 4K RESOLUTION, BUT LOOKS FINE AT 1080p.

### 3 - I'M ONLY SHARING THIS PRESET, BECAUSE SOMEONE ASKED. SO I HAVE NO INTENTION TO SUPPORT, UPDATE, OR MAKE CHANGES.

### 4 - USING DIFFERENT CORES, THAN WHAT MY SCREENSHOT CAPTIONS SAY. MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENT COLORS IN GAMES. SINCE CORE SETTINGS CAN HAVE DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR COLOR PALETTES.

## Description
* This is a Mega Bezel shader Preset I made for myself, to use with RetroArch. For games you would have played on a CRT TV from the 90s.
* The Mega Bezel shader comes pre-installed with RetroArch, if it is not for some reason, you can get it from here - https://github.com/HyperspaceMadness/Mega_Bezel
* In order to keep it simple (cause I'm lazy) I only made two preset files, one if your using an N64 core (since the screen flips), and one for everything else.
* I made this preset from looking at a lot of IRL pictures of TVs. In order to get it close to how I used to play these old games back then, in my bedroom at night.
* This preset does not smooth out checkerboard dithering (example: Sonic 1 waterfalls). I tried to do this, but it results in text in some games (Mario World), being unreadable.
  I wanted an all-in-one preset, so I gave up on it. This dosn't bother me personally. Since newer TVs broke this effect anyways, from what I rememeber.
