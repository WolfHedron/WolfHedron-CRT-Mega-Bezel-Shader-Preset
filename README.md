## Description
* This is a Mega Bezel Shader Preset I made for myself, to use with RetroArch. For games you would have played on a CRT TV from the 90s.
* Technacally it's a hybrid of a TV, and a Commador 64 monitor. I actually played a lot of my systems on a C64 monitor back then, due to the sharper and more colorful image.
* The Mega Bezel Shader comes pre-installed with RetroArch, if it is not for some reason, you can get it from here - https://github.com/HyperspaceMadness/Mega_Bezel
* I made this preset from looking at a lot of IRL pictures of TVs. In order to get it close to how I used to play these old games back then, in my bedroom at night.
* View the screenshots below to see examples, and what other types of presets are included.
